        A woman's place is anywhere and everywhere she feels empowered. The
        W-Wing of the SVCE ACM student chapter aims to bring together like
        minded women to celebrate their technical skills and knowledge, and
        inspire one another in the process. Yet Another Hackathon '22, is one
        such technical and collaborative convocation that aspires to level the
        competition that drives it. As an initiative to encourage the
        participation of women, the SVCE ACM W-Wing is offering an INR 150
        discount to every individual participating in an all women team.
